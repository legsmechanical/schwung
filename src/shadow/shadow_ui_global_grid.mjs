/*
 * shadow_ui_global_grid.mjs — Global Settings, expressed as a module contract.
 *
 * Global Settings is not a module: it publishes no ui_hierarchy and its values
 * come from half a dozen different backends (shadow params, TTS, overlay
 * knobs, display mirror, feature flags). But everything the page engine needs
 * is a hierarchy plus chain_params, so the contract is synthesised here — the
 * same trick shadow_ui_slot_grid.mjs plays for a slot and for Master FX, and
 * the one buildSynthHierarchyFromChainParams plays for a component that
 * declares none of its own.
 *
 * Seven sections become seven levels, each planning to exactly ONE page. Six
 * are grids; Updates is a menu, the page kind that exists for entries with a
 * name, a consequence and nothing to show. One section, one page is what makes
 * sections-as-levels work at all: a section that spilled to two pages would
 * put the bank bar in charge of a split nobody chose, and the split would
 * arrive silently, so tests/host/test_global_settings_contract.sh pins the
 * per-section counts rather than trusting the shapes to stay put. Audio sits
 * at exactly nine.
 *
 * WHY NOT IN shadow_ui_slot_grid.mjs.
 *
 * That file holds TWO contracts on purpose, and warns that "Master FX getting
 * its own file is precisely how the two chain editors drifted apart in the
 * first place: one reasonable-sounding scope boundary at a time, until the
 * knob card worked on one screen and not the other." That warning is answered
 * here, not stepped around.
 *
 * The test it implies is SHARED SUBSTANCE, not shared topic. Those two live
 * together because they share the LFO pages outright — lfoParams / lfoLevels
 * is one declaration serving both — so splitting them would immediately
 * produce two copies of it, and every future LFO change would have to be made
 * twice or land on one screen only. Global Settings shares no page with
 * either: no LFO, no chain prefix, no preset actions, no per-slot storage
 * conventions, a wholly different accessor set. There is nothing here to
 * duplicate by separating it, so separating it cannot start the drift the
 * warning describes.
 *
 * The rule is the substance, not the filename. If Global Settings ever grows a
 * page shared with the slot contract, that page moves into the shared file.
 *
 * PURE. Hand it accessors and it tests with no UI, no device and no
 * framebuffer; nothing here reads a global, and the contract builds with no io
 * at all — a declaration that needs an accessor to exist has stopped being a
 * declaration. Accessor routing (which backend each key reads and writes, and
 * the persistence side effects that must ride along with a write) is NOT here;
 * it is the io built alongside this, the same division as createSlotGridIo.
 */

/*
 * Long options and short options are ONE mechanism with two renderings.
 *
 * The enum SQUARE sets three characters a line in the 5x3 font, so "Native"
 * comes out "Nat/ive" and reads as gibberish. Every other surface — the
 * held-knob header, the list row, the enum picker — has room for the real
 * word and exists to show it. So `options` stays long and `short_options`
 * serves only the square (render_page_movy.mjs consults it there and nowhere
 * else).
 *
 * Generalised, and this is the part worth carrying forward: any value too long
 * for a cell is a short_options entry, never a second code path. A case
 * short_options cannot express is a signal to extend the shared formatter —
 * not to branch on which surface is drawing.
 */
const OFF_ON = { options: ["Off", "On"], short_options: ["OFF", "ON"] };

/*
 * NAMES ARE WRITTEN OUT IN FULL. Do not abbreviate them here.
 *
 * The first cut of this contract spelled every name for the eight-cell knob
 * grid — "Pad Typ", "Text Prv", "Move>Sch", "Brws Prv", "Auto Chk". Then the
 * screen was pinned to the LIST, which has room for the whole word, and the
 * abbreviations were left describing a surface it no longer uses. Reported
 * from the device: *"why are these truncated?"*
 *
 * They were wrong even for the grid. `labelForCell` / `WORD_ABBREV` in
 * render_page_movy.mjs already squeeze a name into a cell, per WORD and with a
 * fixed mnemonic per concept — that is a renderer's job, and doing it by hand
 * here both duplicates it and does it worse.
 *
 * One abbreviation did real damage. `midi_indicator_enabled` became "MIDI Ch",
 * which collides with Master FX's genuine "MIDI Ch" — its listen channel, an
 * entirely different setting. This one is "MIDI Channel", the indicator.
 *
 * These strings are the labels the bespoke screen used, restored verbatim, and
 * tests/host/test_global_settings_contract.sh pins them.

 * **2**, so an index-is-value assumption writes 1 — a mode that does not
 * exist — and the setting appears to do nothing. The io built on this contract

 * WHICH BACKEND EACH KEY READS AND WRITES, and what must ride along with the

 * Settings, not Master FX) and transcribed here so it is one declaration rather
 * than a shape recovered from a 240-line if-chain.
 *
 * The hazard this table exists for: adjustMasterFxSetting is DELTA-BASED and

 * set a module-level cache var. A converted absolute write that drops either
 * sets the param, looks correct on screen, and loses it on reboot — silently.

 * Three kinds of persistence, and conflating them is how a write goes missing:
 *
 *   "save"  saveMasterFxChainConfig() — the SHARED sink. These are the keys
 *           writeGlobalParam persists via io.persist(), and only these.
 *   "own"   a key-specific writer (savePadTypingConfig, savePadTypingConfig,
 *           …). It is inseparable from the write itself, so it lives in the
 *           host's writeParam beside the assignment it saves, not here — the
 *           generic persist() must not fire for these or every key would look
 *           persisted and the assertion that proves persistence would be
 *           vacuous.
 *   null    the backend persists itself (tts_*, display_mirror_*, the feature
 *           flags), or the value is genuinely session-scoped.
 *
 * `modal` records the writes that raise an overlay. Those are the host's to
 * raise — the hand-off is Task 9 — but they are declared here because a write
 * whose modal is forgotten is the same class of silent loss as a missing save.
 *
 * BACKENDS ARE NAMED IN A DOTTED FORM (`tts.get_speed`, not `tts_get_speed`)
 * and that is deliberate, not cosmetic. This module is asserted PURE against
 * its own source with a regex that cannot tell an identifier from a string
 * literal, so spelling the accessors as identifiers here would trip the purity
 * check with a table that reads nothing. Dotted, they are unambiguously data —
 * and the check keeps its teeth for the case it is actually for.

     * hardware; the dismiss was never a decision, it was the only way out
     * before Shift+Track existed. The exits all survive the flip — tap
     * Note/Session, Shift+Track, or Back — so this changes a reflex, not the
     * reachability of Move.
     *
     * An existing install keeps whatever it has: install.sh preserves the key

     * IT IS A BOOL, AND THAT IS A WIDGET DECISION, NOT A WORDING ONE.
     *
     * It shipped for one round as an enum of ["Exit", "Stay"] — two options,
     * same click behaviour (`flipsOnClick` focuses it in a list and flips it on
     * a grid), and structurally identical meta. It still drew differently:
     * `detectSwitch` in viz.mjs picks the switch pill via `isBooleanMeta`,
     * whose option test is `BOOL_OPTION` — off/on/no/yes/0/1/false/true — so
     * "Exit"/"Stay" fell through to the ENUM SQUARE, the widget that means
     * "there is a list behind this", and peeked its options on the knob.
     * Reported from the device as "why is the setting a menu, unlike display
     * mirroring?".
     *
     * That rule is right and stays: a switch draws its state as a POSITION and
     * cannot show the word "Stay", which is why `docs/PARAM_PAGES.md` records
     * "suppressed on the WIDGET, never on the option count" over 134 fleet
     * cells (Saw/Square, Legato/Trig, Bipolar/Unipolar). Those are genuine
     * two-way CHOICES. This one is a boolean, so it is spelled as one.
     *
     * The name is "Keep Schwung" because the honest "Stay in Schwung" is 87px
     * in a row with 85px of room — the width pin in
     * tests/host/test_global_settings_contract.sh catches it. Naming it for
     * the gesture ("Track Tap") was the previous escape from that 2px and is
     * what forced the enum; the switch matters more than the phrasing.
     *
     * The setting is enforced in the SHIM (schwung_shim.c, the cable-0 Track CC
     * block), not in JS — the dismiss it suppresses is a shim-side state change
     * (shadow_display_mode), and the slot switch it substitutes is the same
     * JUMP_TO_SLOT hand-off Shift+Vol+Track already raises. This row is the

 *   [Module Store] had ALREADY been reduced to a screen that printed
 *   "move.local:7700" and nothing else -- the on-device store was retired when
 *   the install paths stopped working for anyone without a current shim, and
 *   what was left was a signpost wearing a shop's name. It is the Connect row
 *   now, which answers the same question ("where do I get modules") with an
 *   address the user can actually reach and a QR that opens it.
 *
 *   [Check Updates] scanned the catalog over the network and listed what was
 *   outdated, then told you to go to the web manager to install any of it. The
 *   manager shows that same list, next to the button that acts on it. A second
 *   copy on a 128x64 screen that cannot act is a report you have to go
 *   somewhere else to use.
 *
 *   [Help...] stayed, and it is a ROW rather than a menu entry now.
 *
 * The section is "System" and it is ONE PAGE: Analytics, Connect, Help. It was
 * briefly a grid page plus a menu page -- which is what a level carrying both
 * plans -- and that was two jog steps and a second page name to invent, for
 * three rows that fit on one screen with room to spare. See SYSTEM_PARAMS for

 * Global Settings as a ui_hierarchy plus chain_params.
 *
 * Root carries no params of its own — it is pure navigation, so it plans to no
 * page and the sections are the whole page set. Its nav entries are what name
 * each page: planPages prefers a nav entry's label over the level's own, which
 * is the label users already see.
 *
 * HELP IS NOT AN ENTRY HERE, and it was, twice, in two different wrong ways.
 * First as an action on ROOT, which reads well and does nothing: root plans to
 * no page, the planner walks past an entry with no `key` and no `level`, and
 * the section picker enumerates pages — so it had no surface anywhere. Then as
 * a `menu` on the System level, which works and costs that section a second
 * page. It is a write-only PARAM on System now; see SYSTEM_PARAMS.
 *
 * @param {object} [io]  unused by the declaration; accepted so the call shape
 *   matches createSlotGridIo's and so a future runtime-shaped section (one
 *   whose entries are only known at build time) has somewhere to read from
 *   without every call site changing.
 * @returns {{hierarchy: object, chainParams: Array}}

 * decided here (which key is an enum, what its stored value is, which writes
 * must persist); the host half is only the concrete backends and the cache-var
 * assignments that cannot leave shadow_ui.js. There is exactly one routing
 * table and it is the one above.
 *
 * Nothing here is modulated and nothing here is an LFO target, so there is no
 * isModulated and no formatValue — unlike the two chain contracts, whose
 * versions exist to stop the host's generic modulation oracle spending three
 * IPC round trips per tick to answer "no" and then answering "yes" by mistake.

 *   the key-specific side effects (cache var, own save fn, modal).
