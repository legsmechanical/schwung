# The E16 lifecycle: seek, hold, give back.
#
# Every property here fails SILENTLY on hardware, which is why they are pinned
# against an injected clock instead of a device:
#
#   - a probe that ignores its interval floods the external MIDI buffer, which
#     is shared with everything else Schwung sends out of cable 2. Nothing
#     errors; other traffic just starts getting refused.
#   - a probe that never repeats after the ACK cannot recover a device that was
#     unplugged -- the E16 has no battery, so a replug is a power cycle out of
#     remote mode and the device says nothing about it.
#   - a `send` that returned false has NOT gone out (docs/SYSEX.md, "OUT: a
#     false return means retry"). Advancing the probe clock past a refused
#     send is a message the device never sees and nothing ever re-sends.
#   - an EXIT that is skipped leaves the device blank with the feature off.
#
# The assembler half is the four rules from docs/SYSEX.md, two of which look
# optional and are not: a realtime byte inside a SysEx run is legal, and a
# message interrupted by another status byte must be ABANDONED rather than
# spliced -- splicing produces a message that parses and is fiction.
