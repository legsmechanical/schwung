# A GATED BUILD IS NOT A GATED MODULE.
#
# build.sh compiles the test fixtures only under SCHWUNG_BUILD_TEST_MODULES --
# but the generic "Copying module files" loop copies every module.json, .js and
# .mjs it finds under src/modules, regardless. So a fixture whose .so is gated
# still shipped its module.json, with NO .so beside it.
#
# That is not a cosmetic leak. widget-test and gesture-test both declare
# chainable audio_fx, so they appear in the FX picker, and a chain slot
# referencing a module that cannot load is restored on EVERY BOOT -- the shape
# CLAUDE.md records for the breakbeat boot loop. gesture-test had been shipping
# that way already; widget-test would have joined it.
#
# The fix is a scrub under the same gate, which build.sh already does for
# sysex-test. This pins that every fixture is BOTH gated at build AND scrubbed,
# because having only the first is what made the leak invisible.
#
# Source-level, deliberately: the alternative is two full Docker builds per run.
# The real artifact check happens in the release flow; this catches the edit
# that drops a fixture from the scrub list.
