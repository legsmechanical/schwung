# Every SHIPPED built-in module ships help that the viewer can actually show.
#
# Two mechanisms put 13 modules into a state where they carried kilobytes of
# documentation nobody has ever read, and neither produces an error anywhere:
#
#  1. `if (helpData.children)` is the WHOLE loader test (shadow_ui.js). A
#     help.json that parses but names its topics anything else -- sections,
#     pages, parameters -- is discarded, and the viewer says "No help content
#     available", identical to shipping nothing at all.
#  2. Help lines clip in PIXELS, not characters. drawScrollableText prints at
#     x=4 and set_pixel drops anything past x=127, so the budget is 123px --
#     and load_font trims every glyph to its inked extent, which makes the
#     runtime font PROPORTIONAL even though the atlas is fixed-pitch. A "20
#     character" budget derived from the atlas called 11 shipped lines
#     defective that all fit. Measure pixels.
#
# The font is printable ASCII with no fallback, so a stray dash or ellipsis
# renders as a hole.
#
# gesture-test is excluded deliberately: it is a test fixture ("one knob row of
# every parameter kind"), not a module anyone reaches for. wav-player too -- it
# is a headless preview player driven by the file browser, with no UI and no
# parameters of its own.
